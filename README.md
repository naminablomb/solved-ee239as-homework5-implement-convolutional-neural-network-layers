You should complete the notebooks in order, i.e., CNN-Layers, followed by CNN-BatchNorm, followed by CNN. This is due to potential dependencies. Note however, that CNN can be completed without CNN-Layers, since we provide the fast implementation of the CNN layers to be used in question 3.

<ol>

 <li><strong>Implement convolutional neural network layers. </strong>Complete the CNNLayers.ipynb Jupyter notebook. Print out the entire workbook and relevant code and submit it as a pdf to gradescope. Download the CIFAR-10 dataset, as you did in earlier homework.</li>

 <li><strong>Implement spatial normalization for CNNs. </strong>Complete the CNN-BatchNorm.ipynb Jupyter notebook. Print out the entire workbook and relevant code and submit it as a pdf to gradescope.</li>

 <li><strong>Optimize your CNN for CIFAR-10. </strong>Complete the CNN.ipynb Jupyter notebook. Print out the entire workbook and relevant code and submit it as a pdf to gradescope.</li>
